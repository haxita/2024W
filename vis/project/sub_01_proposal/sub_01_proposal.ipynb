    "**Description:** We chose the _Student Performance Data Set_, which focuses on analyzing secondary school student achievement in two Portuguese schools, specifically in Mathematics and Portuguese language courses. It combines academic performance data (grades G1, G2, G3) with demographic, social, and school-related attributes gathered from school reports and questionnaires.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset includes 32 attributes such as age, gender, family size, parental education, study habits, and extracurricular involvement. Behavioral factors like alcohol consumption, free time, and romantic relationships are also covered. Grades G1 and G2 correlate strongly with the final grade, G3, as they represent earlier evaluation periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We chose this dataset for its combination of academic, social, and demographic features, which provides opportunities for multifaceted analyses like predicting performance, understanding influencing factors, or identifying high-risk students. Its relevance to education makes it intriguing, as it bridges the gap between academics and broader social behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset contains two separate files for Mathematics (395 records, ~56 KB) and Portuguese courses (649 records, ~92 KB)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We sourced the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/impapan/student-performance-data-set), which originally references a study by Cortez and Silva [1] utilizing data mining techniques.\n",

This is attributed to factors such as better health (health), fewer absences (absences), a balanced social life (goout), reduced stress levels (indirectly measured by freetime and famrel), and more study time (studytime). These factors collectively contribute to higher academic achievement."
