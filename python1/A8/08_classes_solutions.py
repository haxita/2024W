# Task 1
#

# Create a class "Face" with an attribute "orientation" and two methods
# "look(new_orientation)" and "show()". "new_orientation" is a string argument.
# If "new_orientation" is the string "left", let the attribute "orientation"
# point to string "left". If "new_orientation" is the string "right", let the
# attribute "orientation" point to string "right". "show" should print a face in
# "right" or "left" orientation, based on the current value of "orientation".
# The default initialization is "left". Example:
# face = Face()
# face.look("left")
# face.show()  # Prints "<.<"
# face.look("right")
# face.show()  # Prints ">.>"
# Also implement a method "get_info()" that returns a string of the form:
# "Face is looking <orientation>", where <orientation> is the value of the
# attribute "orientation".

# Your code here #


class Face:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.orientation = "left"
    
    def look(self, new_orientation):
        if new_orientation == "left" or new_orientation == "right":

#
# Task 2
#

# Create a class "OwlFace" that is derived from class "Face" from task 1.
# Override the method "look" as follows: If "new_orientation" is the string
# "left", let the attribute "orientation" point to string "left". If
# "new_orientation" is the string "right", let the attribute "orientation" point
# to string "right". If "new_orientation" is the string "ahead", let the
# attribute "orientation" point to string "ahead". Make sure to reuse code from
# the base class "Face". "show" should print a face in "right", "left" or
# "ahead" orientation, based on the current value of "orientation". Example:
# face = OwlFace()
# face.look("left")
# face.show()  # Prints "(O<O)"
# face.look("right")
# face.show()  # Prints "(O>O)"
# face.look("ahead")
# face.show()  # Prints "(OvO)"
# Also implement a method "get_info()" that returns a string of the form:
# "OwlFace is looking <orientation>", where <orientation> is the value of the
# attribute "orientation". Try to reuse as much code as possible from the base
# class "Face". Ideally, you do not need to override this method at all!

# Your code here #

    def look(self, new_orientation):
        if new_orientation == "ahead":

            print("(O<O)")
        elif self.orientation == "right":
            print("(O>O)")
        elif self.orientation == "ahead":

face = OwlFace()
face.look("left")
face.show()
face.look("right")
face.show()
face.look("ahead")
face.show()
print(face.get_info())


# Alternative solution with overriding only the helper method "_get_name":
class OwlFace(Face):
    
    def _get_name(self):
        return "OwlFace"
    
    def look(self, new_orientation):

#
# Task 3
#

# Create a class "Transformer" with two methods that operate on numerical lists:
#   > _transform(self, list_): A "private" method that takes a list as input,
#     processes/transforms this list and returns the processed/transformed list.
#     Since "Transformer" does not convey which transform operation should be
#     performed, the method should be considered "abstract", i.e., without any
#     actual implementation: Use "raise NotImplementedError" to indicate that
#     subclasses must overwrite this method. For more details, see
#     https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NotImplementedError
#   > transform(self, lists): This method takes a list of lists as input and
#     calls the "_transform" method for each list, collecting the returned lists
#     into a new list which is then returned.
# Afterwards, create these concrete transformer classes (concrete meaning that
# you have to implement the abstract method "_transform"):
#   > "AbsTransformer": Extends "Transformer". Returns the absolute values in
#     the list.
#   > "ScaleTransformer": Extends "Transformer". Has an "__init__" method with
#     two arguments "min_" and "max_" that will be used to scale the values in
#     the list to the interval [min_, max_].
#   > "NormalizeTransformer": Extends "ScaleTransformer" by setting "min_" and
#     "max_" to 0 and 1, respectively (i.e., a "NormalizeTransformer" is simply
#     a "ScaleTransformer" with 0 and 1 as fixed values).
# Finally, create a transformer object of each of the three classes and apply
# their transformation on the given input "example_lists:
#
# example_lists = [[0, 2, 7], [-1, -2, 10, 13, -1, 5]]
# example_lists -> AbsTransformer -> ScaleTransformer (with min_=1 anx max_=10)
# -> NormalizeTransformer
#
# The final result after the normalization transformation should be the
# following list (minor precision differences due to floating point numbers
# might occur):
# [[0.0, 0.2857142857142857, 1.0],
#  [0.0, 0.09999999999999999, 0.8999999999999999, 1.0, 0.0, 0.39999999999999997]]
